Hello There!
The first program takesinput from the user and prints the factorials of that number.
The second program, i modified it by letting the user be in charge of what they want to do. I gave the user choices:
                                                                                                  1) log
                                                                                                  2) sin
                                                                                                  3) sqrt
                                                                                                  4) All of the above
  so now the user can print all or anyone they want to print.

  -Thank You!
